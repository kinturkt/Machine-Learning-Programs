🏠 Housing Price Prediction
This repository contains a Housing Price Prediction model developed using machine learning techniques. The project is aimed at predicting house prices based on various features like area, number of bedrooms, bathrooms, etc.

🚀 Project Overview
The goal of this project is to create a regression model that predicts the prices of houses using features such as area, furnishing status, and location. 
The project includes:

Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values, feature encoding, and scaling.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizing and analyzing the relationships between features and the target variable (price).
Modeling: Using machine learning models like Linear Regression, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting to predict house prices.
Model Evaluation: Evaluating models using metrics such as RMSE and R² score.
